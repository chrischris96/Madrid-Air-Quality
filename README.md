# Madrid Air Quality
 Analysing the air quality in the Madrid central area with
 data from the last two decades. For the beginning the
 stations are plotted to show where the data is recorded.
 
 The calleavdandctra_madrid_huge.png shows the output of the code, plotting all infrastructure in Madrid named 
 "calle", "avenia" or "carretera" in one image. If you look closly you can see red dots in the city center.
 Those dots refer to the points where the air measurements took place.
